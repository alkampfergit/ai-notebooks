pipes in the space directly behind where the mount will be installed.

1\. The bottom of the mounting template sticker should be level and at least 103cm from
the ground. The top should have at least 30cm* of clearance above it.

2\. Use a power drill with an 8mm drill bit to drill a hole into each marker on the mounting
template sticker, then insert a wall plug into each hole.

3\. Align the locating holes on the mount with the holes on the wall. Fasten it to the wall
with the included screws.

*30cm: Leave enough space just in case you
may need to purchase the replaceable battery
in the future.
